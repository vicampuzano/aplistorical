# Aplistorical: Amplitude to Posthog migration tool
_‚ÄúAplistorical‚Äù sounds like ‚Äúahistorical‚Äù because it prevents you to be lacking historical perspective or context._ üò¨

This tool helps you migrate your historical data from Amplitude to Posthog.

It is based on Laravel so you can use it as a normal Laravel project or inside a Docker image using `sail` commands.

## Important notes before start
**This tool is currently in beta**. We have done some tests in production environments and everything was fine. But, we can‚Äôt ensure you this will happen in your particular scenario. Please, **check the complete migration in a testing environment before doing it in the production one**.

**Ensure you have been set the same timezone in both your Amplitude and Posthog projects** to avoid having discrepancies caused by timezone offsets.



## Amplitude to Posthog migration process
3 steps are needed to perform a complete migration process.

1. Download all data from Amplitude.
2. Translate events from Amplitude format to Posthog format.
3. Upload events to your Posthog project.

**This is how you‚Äôll do it:**

### 1. Create a Migration Job
A Migration Job is a set of configurations related to the migration for one Amplitude project to one Posthog project. With a Migration Job you‚Äôll define from what date to start retrieving data from Amplitude and when to stop.

Also, a Migration Job stores the API keys and other information needed to do all work.

**To create a migration job:**
```
(php or sail) artisan aplistorical:createMigrationJob
```

You‚Äôll be asked for all the information needed to create the Migration Job.

You can also specify all the information using parameters and options. See bellow  `(or use the -h option)`  to a full description of this command.

### 2. Download all files using the Amplitude export API
By using the command `(php or sail) artisan aplistorical:getFromAmplitude {jobIb}` command, a backup of all your Amplitude events will be downloaded and stored in the `storage/app/migrationJobs/{jobIb}/down/` folder.

Depending on your events volume and the time range, this task takes a while for downloading and unzipping all files. 

Showing a progress bar is currently in the ‚ÄúToDo‚Äù list but you can check the `laravel.log` file for debug information.

### 3. Process all files and send events to Posthog
Since you have all files downloaded and unzipped, you should process them to translate Amplitude events to Posthog events and send them to a Posthog server.

You can start the process by using:
```
(php or sail) artisan aplistorical:processFolder {jobId}
```

This command process all files downloaded from Amplitude, translates all events stored in them and sends the events to Posthog in batches defined by the `--destination-batch=XXXX` option for the `aplistorical:createMigrationJob`command.

Every single file is deleted after be processed.

**Note:** failed batches are stored in `storage/app/migrationsJobs/{jobId}/up/failedSends.json` so you can review it and resend using your own code or any tool like  ([Postman](https://www.postman.com/)).


## Mapped properties
Every Amplitude event is translated to a Posthog event using this properties concordance.

| Amplitude JSON property | Posthog JSON property |
| --- | --- |
| `user_id` | `distinct_id` |
| `event_time` | `timestamp` , `properties.$time`  and `properties.$timestamp`|
| `event_type` | `event` |
| `ip_address` | `$ip` |
| `library` | `$lib` |
| `version_name` | `$lib_version` |
| `device_id` | `properties.device_id` |
| `os` | `properties.$os_version` |
| `event_properties.language` | `properties.locale` |
| `event_properties.*` | `properties.*` |
| `user_properties.*` | `properties.$set.*` |

### Considerations
We create a single $idenfity event in Posthog for **every distinct user on a single file** using the traits includes in the `user_properties`properties of this user‚Äôs 1st event in this file.

You can set `--user-properies-mode` to `root` or `property` to put Amplitude's user_properties as Posthog event properties (at root level or under user_properties inside the event properties, respectively).

We also use `$pageview` as the `event` in Posthog when the `event_type`equals `Viewed Page`, `PageVisited`or `pagevisited` in Amplitude.


## Artisan Commands

### üñ≤ aplistorical:createMigrationJob
Use this command to create a Migration Job by providing date from, date to and all the information to connect with both source and destination. 

You will receive a Migration Job ID that should be used for downloading and processing events.

touch storage/aplistorical/db/database.sqlite
(sail or php) artisan migrate:fresh
